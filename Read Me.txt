Summary
----------------------
Lost life is simple dungeon type game where the user uses the arrow keys to
navigate the 'hero' dungeon past enemies, that move to a random space every time
the player moves, and hazards like water or pits, to take possession of the red
gem and get back to the entrance.  Walking into a hazard automatically results in
death.  Touching an enemy loses one life bar.  When the life bar is empty the
player has died and the game is over.  

The unique aspect of this game is that the board is regenerated randomly upon 
every new instance of play.
